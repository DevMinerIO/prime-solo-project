## PROJECT NAME
Game Changer by Tim Miner

## Description
Duration: 2 Week Sprint

During these 2 weeks,I set out to create a basketball stat tracking app for both players and coaches to see player stats. From the coaches view they will be able to view stats and add/remove games from the schedule. On the player view, they are able to add, update, and update thier stats each game. This added utility will help unify basketball programs thoughout the different skill levels. While also allowing clarity on player performace game by game.  


## Prerequisites
Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

Node.js
npm install (will automatically install other libraries. Such as express, and redux)
[Postico] (https://eggerapps.at/postico/)
## Installation
How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

Create a database named basketball_app and follow directions in the database.sql file,
The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries,
Open up your editor of choice and run an npm install
Run npm run server in your terminal
Run npm run client in your terminal
The npm run client command will open up a new browser tab for you!
## Usage
How does someone use this application?

1.Login to already setup user accounts. For the player view User: tiny Password:1234 ... or for coaches view User: coachNorton Password: 1234
2. If in player view, you will have the ability to see player stats, and edit your own stats. 
3. If in coaches View you will have the ability to add or remove games to the schedule, along with both viewing and editing player stats.
